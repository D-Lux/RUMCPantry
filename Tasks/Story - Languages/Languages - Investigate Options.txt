We have several clients that don't speak English well, if at all.

We need to investigate what options we have to assist these clients with using the program.


Suggestions: 

Option 1: String Library with translations for all normal strings (requires a language field for all item names for each language we will want, or a string lookup, which will be a fun excursion)

Option 2: See if there's some package out there that can do translations (like google translate) that we can use relatively easily.
