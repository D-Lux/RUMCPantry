Redistributions work a little differently than normal client interactions, so custom items might need to be generated under a 'redistribution' category that doesn't show up in other parts of the program but are the only things that show up for these.

These are things like: A Banana Box of Bread, 10 lbs of Chipotle Meat, etc.
